RMay expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable object 
gThis code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the internal representation of the 
e  object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object 
f  would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. 
G  Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.
